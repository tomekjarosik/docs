1. Learn `git` tool and version control (also, GitHub which is nice visual organizer on top of `git` ecosystem)

2. Set up learning environment for:
* Python: download PyCharm Community edition (https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/)
* Java: download IntelliJ Community edition (https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) and create new gradle project in it
* Golang: download Gogland: https://www.jetbrains.com/go/

Why all 3? Because a language is just a form of expression of an intention. And with all three at the beginning you will start noticing differences and similarities, and similarities are the things that are present in many languages.

3. Write a simple program, printing "Hello World!", and run it in all 3 environments (Look for tutorials how to do it)

4. Learn basic programmers terminology. Start with very basic:
